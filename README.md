# SchedulerApp

This is a program developed for matching potential new members with current members for a student organization at the University of Chicago

In order for the program to work, 2 CSV files are necessary. In both files, the first column in the file must be the names of everyone who needs to be matched
All subsequent columns must be a unique timeslot (eg 9-10AM) or a unique word that needs to be matched with people in the first column. 

The output is a unique CSV files with all the possible combinations in one sheet
